    <article>About Me</article> 
    <p>I enjoy riding my bike for fun on weekends, I usually bring my Godbrothers with me for the ride. My other hobbies include dancing, working out, making youtube videos and playing video games. I've got a good relationship with my dad and sister. I can alternate between morning person and night owl pretty easily, which was a surprise to me when I first discorved it.</p>
    <p>Once out of college I plan on writing my own <em>light novel</em>, while I work freelance and continue my journey on YouTube. Then when all is said done, I'll start working my webcomic if not then, then earlier. <sup>My dream is</sup> to eventually raise enough money to go buy a farm somewhere, where me and my wife could raise family and eventually die in peace.</p>
    <p>"Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."</p>
